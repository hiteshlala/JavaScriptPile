#JavaScript Pile

A collection of functions written for practice. I tried to separate some
functions which stand alone as a project and could potentially be useful
at a later time to make them easier to find.


###play.js
a file that has a hodge podge of functions some recursion etc	this one gets edited regularly.  I keep adding functions

###permutations.js
a basic function to permute using recursion.  Did this some time	ago and definitely needs revisiting

###phoneNumToText.js
was trying to get a list of text strings from a phone	number.  Works but you het a huge list so beware

###recursiveTrees.js
recursive function to create a branching tree, can adjust the number of iterations and length of the arms on initial tree

###sierpinski.js
recursively generate the Sierpinski triangles.  Can adjust the number of iterations.

###convexHull.js
calculates the smallest boundary of a group of points in a plane.  I implemented Grahams solution orignally published in  the 1970's but I found on Wikipedia

###towersOfHanoi.js
recursively solves the Towers of Hanoi porblem.  Have a funcion that returns a table of moves and a function that prints the moves directly on the screen.

###flattenObject.js
a function that takes a hierarchical map of properties and converts it to a single, flattened map, with the different levels separated by a forward slash ('/').

###romanNumeral.js
Roman Numeral Converter
two functions to convert a given number into a roman numeral. One is iterative the other recursive.  Iterative makes more intuitive sense to me.

###deepEquals.js
a function that, given two objects, returns whether or not the two are deeply equivalent--meaning the structure of the two objects is the same, and so is the structure of each of their corresponding descendants.

###anagrams.js
a function that given a string returns all anagrams.  Basically all permutaions of the string are retruned in an array.
